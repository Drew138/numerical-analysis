    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two matrices $A$ and $B$, each with $n$ rows and columns. Matrix multiplication is defined as the result of the dot product of every $ith$ row of matrix $A$ by each $jth$ column of matrix $B$. This operation yields a new matrix of $n^2$ dimmensions, where the $ijth$ position contains the product of the computations previously described.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases for this kind of operation are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "* Solving intricate graph problems.\n",
    "* Representing the logic gates applied in a quantum system.\n",
    "* Applying rotations to projected objects in a 3D plane (Computer Graphics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Among many others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being an extremely useful operation, it regretably can not be used in every desired scenario.<br/> \n",
    "Due to the nature of the operations required to calculate the resulting matrix. Cases where we deal with matrixes of great dimmensions rapidly become unfeasible, leaving a vast amount of problems unsolved. For this reason, it is always important to use efficient methods when dealing with great ammounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merely reading, and writing operations of matrices take $O(n^2)$ time and space, setting a hard cap of $O(n^2)$ for any implementation of an algorithm aiming to do matrix multiplication. Nonetheless, in reality it is much worse, since time complexities for most algorithms range from approximately $O(n^{2.5})$ to $O(n^3)$. Because of this some algorithms also try to leverage parallelism in order speed up operations. However, improvements in performance do not increase a lot from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper we will be analyzing various matrix multiplication algorithms, the logic behind them, and their performance in benchmarks using various programming languages."
